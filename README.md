# Mental-Health-Risk-Prediction
An end-to-end mental health risk prediction system using NLP and personality traits. It predicts Big Five traits from text using a DistilBERT regressor, then classifies mental health risk (Low/Mid/High) via a BiLSTM model. Built with PyTorch, Transformers, and real-world datasets (MBTI, CLPsych).

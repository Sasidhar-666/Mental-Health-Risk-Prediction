thats just how I read it What about a four dimensional planeWhy airplane why not aeroplaneHit them for having the expectation that you should live up to their expectations which is infuriating in and of itself probablyIts just because hitting a women is politically incorrect and some women will use that to their advantageWhat hes saying is that they should assume that if they say something worthy

dates to find one that clicks isnt going to be as viable  That has nothing to do with maintaining a relationship IHow youve come to the conclusion I have nothing to offer  merely because I am busy is beyond me       No not really Again more made up stuffokay this isnt cool  youre specifically looking to get into a relationship because youre about to enter a life phase where you will not have any resources to give to a relationship   that isI do take it slow thats why Im still single but Im not interested in making friends I  have friends Enough for my liking Im interested in going on dates with the intent of entering aAbsolutely not for me I find the idea repugnant actuallyPeople could have been polite Maybe average is a more conservative bet And Im not claiming Im a social butterfly Im just a normal guy who is introverted but not a social doofus  I dontIm probably giving up the online thing here when my next subscription runs out After that I really dont know where to look Bars are a definite no I dont understand where people meet theirIve tried both ways actually The last few women I have gone out with have gotten really weird andor ignored my backhanded compliments I dont know what to do anymore Seems I get screwed eitherIm actually pretty healthy     Sorry you feel that way Not sure which ones you met but assholes exist everywhere The number isnt anywhere near 99 thoughIf anything I err on the side of being indifferent Definitely not overeagerYeah my close friends dont live near me anymore  The issue is that I have been meeting people a good amount and nothing works I want to know why it is that deformed infirm mentally unstableMy friends are in worse positions than I am Asking them isnt going to help   As far as feedback not really because that seems like an extraordinarily awkward thing to ask someone you barelySo Im a 26 year old male who has been striking out time and time again when it comes to relationships Ive been in one relationship my entire life that lasted like 15 years and ended when I wasI dont think this sort of dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive Being friends first just throws a wrench in what is normally a smooth dating process When you fearNever was a kissI appreciate the feedback I think Im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it What is happening right now is dragging things out andI dont know After thinking more Im on the verge of giving up It has nothing to do with seeing her infrequently or not making it official or what have you Its that she keeps thingsI dont know Im not a model or anything but Im decent looking Shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart Guys are always after her it seems But Im also smarter and have better careerI like your answer but maybe Im just being optimistic It is basically what Ive been doing I cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested andHow am I supposed to know if an  just wants to be friends Things have been very weird with an  Ive been seeing Ive been very upfront about my intentions and she essentially told me sheInteresting I find it unusual INFJs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the responses so far have indicated kissing in 3 or fewer datesMy  friend has been with an  and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he was putting her down and felt caged I can see thatEnlighten us infjs Also indicate your gender and if you initiatedWell there was more than that She also said she was basically trying to figure out if Im trustworthy and decentThose two things seem at odds How can you be simultaneously not saying things that need to be said but also being proactively aggressivePretty much yeah Women just do not enjoy my company on any level Im in the same situation Never had any female friends dated one person in my life and it lasted a little less than two years TheI dont think that is going to help me dig myself out of the very clingy seeming hole I dug myself I basically asked her if she knew I was romantically interested and she responded of course lolI should have just let things proceed at a natural pace Pretty pissed at myself About zero chance she speaks to me againI read through most of that thread From what I can tell I never did anything egregious Good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though lolI broke that off shortly after my post I felt like a slime ball I only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and I should see other people BTW I have a very well developedUpdate on this Told her I liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested Those who said she was ambivalent were right Im pretty much calling it off at this pointYeah so I told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt She basically said she had known for a while I like her Pretty much what I expected Probably going to call itIs the crystal ball reference supposed to mean your guess is as good as mine or what Edit guess not pSo Ive gone on six or so dates with an  over a 3 month period shes pretty busy and me too and recently I feel like progress has been a little glacial For a bit I thought she was warming upShe hates texting  And yeah she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of dayYou would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder I would know  Not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friends how much you like them That would be more than bizarreIts kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head For all I know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assaultSpoke to her last night she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to But she also indirectly used the word friend but itSo I met an  female a while back and weve been out like five or so times on a date They go well we get along everything seems nice I find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in  I dont know I kind of have a rule that I dont compliment a female on her appearance until she trusts me I did compliment her personality a few times  She is extremely cautious from what IWell now I have a new question Went on a second date a few days ago and it went well and she said she wanted to meet up again The problem is there hasnt been an ounce of flirting or touchingShe started initiating with me and asked if Im free soon     If there is anything to be learned it is dont play the analysis game

this isnt theI dont know I cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know Number 2 is cruel but it is how modern dating works    Pretty sure this isnt theThanks option 1 seems most likely It seems whenever I finally get her to open up there is like a cascade of good conversation that finally ensues but it is like pulling teeth initially Then IIm socially retarded and would know that if a random stranger asked for my contact info then asked me out for drinks or lunch then the person probably isnt interested in just being friendsSo I shouldnt be deterred by the fact she doesnt really ever reach out to me I dont enjoy appearing like someone who cant take a hint or who puts someone else in an awkward situation I worryNo this seems to fit her

want to know why it is that deformed infirm mentally unstablemy friends are in worse positions than i am asking them isnt going to help   as far as feedback not really because that seems like an extraordinarily awkward thing to ask someone you barelyso im a 26 year old male who has been striking out time and time again when it comes to relationships ive been in one relationship my entire life that lasted like 15 years and ended when i wasi dont think this sort of dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive being friends first just throws a wrench in what is normally a smooth dating process when you fearnever was a kissi appreciate the feedback i think im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it what is happening right now is dragging things out andi dont know after thinking more im on the verge of giving up it has nothing to do with seeing her infrequently or not making it official or what have you its that she keeps thingsi dont know im not a model or anything but im decent looking shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guys are always after her it seems but im also smarter and have better careeri like your answer but maybe im just being optimistic it is basically what ive been doing i cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested andhow am i supposed to know if an  just wants to be friends things have been very weird with an  ive been seeing ive been very upfront about my intentions and she essentially told me sheinteresting i find it unusual infjs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the responses so far have indicated kissing in 3 or fewer datesmy  friend has been with an  and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he was putting her down and felt caged i can see thatenlighten us infjs also indicate your gender and if you initiatedwell there was more than that she also said she was basically trying to figure out if im trustworthy and decentthose two things seem at odds how can you be simultaneously not saying things that need to be said but also being proactively aggressivepretty much yeah women just do not enjoy my company on any level im in the same situation never had any female friends dated one person in my life and it lasted a little less than two years thei dont think that is going to help me dig myself out of the very clingy seeming hole i dug myself i basically asked her if she knew i was romantically interested and she responded of course loli should have just let things proceed at a natural pace pretty pissed at myself about zero chance she speaks to me againi read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anything egregious good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though loli broke that off shortly after my post i felt like a slime ball i only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and i should see other people btw i have a very well developedupdate on this told her i liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested those who said she was ambivalent were right im pretty much calling it off at this pointyeah so i told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt she basically said she had known for a while i like her pretty much what i expected probably going to call itis the crystal ball reference supposed to mean your guess is as good as mine or what edit guess not pso ive gone on six or so dates with an  over a 3 month period shes pretty busy and me too and recently i feel like progress has been a little glacial for a bit i thought she was warming upshe hates texting  and yeah she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of dayyou would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder i would know  not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friends how much you like them that would be more than bizarreits kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assaultspoke to her last night she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to but she also indirectly used the word friend but itso i met an  female a while back and weve been out like five or so times on a date they go well we get along everything seems nice i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in  i dont know i kind of have a rule that i dont compliment a female on her appearance until she trusts me i did compliment her personality a few times  she is extremely cautious from what iwell now i have a new question went on a second date a few days ago and it went well and she said she wanted to meet up again the problem is there hasnt been an ounce of flirting or touchingshe started initiating with me and asked if im free soon     if there is anything to be learned it is dont play the analysis game you will loseexpectations ofi dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number 2 is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thei dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number 2 is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thethanks option 1 seems most likely it seems whenever i finally get her to open up there is like a cascade of good conversation that finally ensues but it is like pulling teeth initially then iim socially retarded and would know that if a random stranger asked for my contact info then asked me out for drinks or lunch then the person probably isnt interested in just being friendsso i shouldnt be deterred by the fact she doesnt really ever reach out to me i dont enjoy appearing like someone who cant take a hint or who puts someone else in an awkward situation i worryno this seems to fit her pretty wellthanks for the advice everyone i appreciate your taking the time to respond\",\n          \"this has to be written with bias or something im not sure how you could even say that truthfully for some reason you put subjectivity for both god and man it says nothing    that makes no how  the main priority of the church is written throughout its texts for the past nearly 2000 years and reverberated throughout the churchs dialogues both before and after the incident aboutthats an annoying phrasing as its just obtuse and confusing to newcomers i dont blame you for your response there    why must the revealed knowledge not speak truth but contain a biasthere are no priestly desk jobs the closest thing you have to being a priest that gets you away from people is being a monk and that in itself is very different  i am telling you they did it outno you really wont you cant just go to an  and assume their intelligence level that would end in failure dont be afraid to ask big questions when musing with the  and just try toheresy is like the core reason most all christian infighting occurs everything else is minor disputes about theological opinionsthats exceedingly subjective see what theyre interested in strike up a conversation about it definitely ask them their thoughtsto dismiss my concept of it is to dismiss all history on the topic dismiss what the apostles taught and literally all sects of christianity but fine whateverdo cool shit discuss ideas have patience dont try to judge personally too quickly or control them also make the first move to show youre interested in talking with themi used to feel about the same until i read the book selfmade man where a lesbian butch woman dressed like a man and tried to live as one she noticed herself being considered a feminine man quiteim not sure what the hell is going on in this thread but i would like to say i know no entjs personally i dont think itd be neat thoughall churches are forms of political institutions catholic and orthodox ones have the benefit of being centralized all sects have declared doctrine in one way or another  youre speaking againstand here is the most boring post in the whole threadwhat part if its the idea of a teaching authority you have a problem with all church until the 13th century if its the idea of a group being guided by the holy spirit in their decisions onfor catholics the church has a dual meaning the whole of the believers the body of christ and the political institution for catholicism their teachings of christ are said to be protected bypriests were relocated to other parishes so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle thing themselves again poor decision but that was their decision  the churchs first prioritywell sure then yes the church did protect child offenders the churchs reasoning was the image of the church itself and the their leaderships own ignorance of the size of the problem the churchedit based double postno it really isnt the bible itself is the canon collection of texts the bible was established once the theological and historical work was done to establish the canon and it was not modifiedyes nevermind it because the two claims do not contradict each other at all i could work through how there is no contradiction if youre struggling    i wouldnt say all no thats a theres no way to tell but many of them depend on logic andor history that contradicts or ruins their claims granted there are a few cases of were yet to be able to know but many of it canthe problem of induction is a grand way of humbling yourself about scientific findings when youre younger it brings into question if what we know is what we could call truerubix cubespantheism makes no sense id advise otherwise atheism and abrahamic theism are the only two rational choicesyou motherfuckerwhat is the meaning of everything the universe exists we are to learn to love in itdisappointed 24 year old reporting in  good luck opthis is exceedingly naive the early church before scripture applied their teaching to better society after scripture it was held in high esteem as a basis to properly better society most workfrom the catholic catechism list of official teaching here is how we are to read the bible  iii the holy spirit interpreter of scripture   109 in sacred scripture god speaks to man in ai never liked people pointing to the scandinavian model for the success of their economic system and not their incredible oil and natural resource supply compared to their small populationswhile shit just got stupid for a moment lets try to get back on trackyoure pretty smart you know that  look at this fucker she thinks im smart pfftexceedingly poorive just been told im bright but im sure most everyone else says the same to the kidsand what of youthe most efficient way to remove selfdoubt is to stop doubting yourself so much faith and trust niggayou suspect wrongly i like the chatter and im being friendly with you i seriously do hope you have a good day tooindeed you do feel free to askarguechator bullshit with me if you want have a good one manid say thats a stretch to say catholics believe the bible was inspired by god but written by men orthodox do too as they assembled the biblical canon id have to say they have the greatest sayedit welpi see the arguments for inconsistencies sometimes they arent actually inconsistencies sometimes they are i find the simplest example of a true one being the rabbit that is apparently chewingsorry to take so long to get back to you my internet has been screwing up horribly  as for the answer there was a considerable amount of things that got me off the atheist train but if i were tothe believing portion was a long and arduous process for me i researched culture as a hobby and eventually i rolled around to religion it was an interesting topic for me and i eventually began toto your first statement just what where did that even come from of course they can know love though with god they can know it fully id argue  as for hell its taken a variety ofim very mixed on him his criticism of christianity and envy now that ive seen the video is while popular piss poor and max scheler did a wonderful job making an argument otherwise on hispeople believing in something as incontrovertibly true is what gets people into a murderous rage why just the incontrovertibly true why not the empirically true why not just majority opinion tosure thing sounds sorta similar to the epicurean paradox  sufferingfree will exists to strengthen the good if you create a people so they may know love they cannot sincerely know love if theyyo christian  here  anything you wantits not we can make healthy children its we only let the

thats just how i read it what about a four dimensional planewhy airplane why not aeroplanehit them for having the expectation that you should live up to their expectations which is infuriating in and

beyond me       no not really again more made up stuffokay this isnt cool  youre specifically looking to get into a relationship because youre about to enter a life phase where you will not have any resources to give to a relationship   that isi do take it slow thats why im still single but im not interested in making friends i  have friends enough for my liking im interested in going on dates with the intent of entering aabsolutely not for me i find the idea repugnant actuallypeople could have been polite maybe average is a more conservative bet and im not claiming im a social butterfly im just a normal guy who is introverted but not a social doofus  i dontim probably giving up the online thing here when my next subscription runs out after that i really dont know where to look bars are a definite no i dont understand where people meet theirive tried both ways actually the last few women i have gone out with have gotten really weird andor ignored my backhanded compliments i dont know what to do anymore seems i get screwed eitherim actually pretty healthy     sorry you feel that way not sure which ones you met but assholes exist everywhere the number isnt anywhere near 99 thoughif anything i err on the side of being indifferent definitely not overeageryeah my close friends dont live near me anymore  the issue is that i have been meeting people a good amount and nothing works i want to know why it is that deformed infirm mentally unstablemy friends are in worse positions than i am asking them isnt going to help   as far as feedback not really because that seems like an extraordinarily awkward thing to ask someone you barelyso im a 26 year old male who has been striking out time and time again when it comes to relationships ive been in one relationship my entire life that lasted like 15 years and ended when i wasi dont think this sort of dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive being friends first just throws a wrench in what is normally a smooth dating process when you fearnever was a kissi appreciate the feedback i think im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it what is happening right now is dragging things out andi dont know after thinking more im on the verge of giving up it has nothing to do with seeing her infrequently or not making it official or what have you its that she keeps thingsi dont know im not a model or anything but im decent looking shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guys are always after her it seems but im also smarter and have better careeri like your answer but maybe im just being optimistic it is basically what ive been doing i cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested andhow am i supposed to know if an  just wants to be friends things have been very weird with an  ive been seeing ive been very upfront about my intentions and she essentially told me sheinteresting i find it unusual infjs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the responses so far have indicated kissing in 3 or fewer datesmy  friend has been with an  and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he was putting her down and felt caged i can see thatenlighten us infjs also indicate your gender and if you initiatedwell there was more than that she also said she was basically trying to figure out if im trustworthy and decentthose two things seem at odds how can you be simultaneously not saying things that need to be said but also being proactively aggressivepretty much yeah women just do not enjoy my company on any level im in the same situation never had any female friends dated one person in my life and it lasted a little less than two years thei dont think that is going to help me dig myself out of the very clingy seeming hole i dug myself i basically asked her if she knew i was romantically interested and she responded of course loli should have just let things proceed at a natural pace pretty pissed at myself about zero chance she speaks to me againi read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anything egregious good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though loli broke that off shortly after my post i felt like a slime ball i only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and i should see other people btw i have a very well developedupdate on this told her i liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested those who said she was ambivalent were right im pretty much calling it off at this pointyeah so i told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt she basically said she had known for a while i like her pretty much what i expected probably going to call itis the crystal ball reference supposed to mean your guess is as good as mine or what edit guess not pso ive gone on six or so dates with an  over a 3 month period shes pretty busy and me too and recently i feel like progress has been a little glacial for a bit i thought she was warming upshe hates texting  and yeah she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of dayyou would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder i would know  not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friends how much you like them that would be more than bizarreits kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assaultspoke to her last night she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to but she also indirectly used the word friend but itso i met an  female a while back and weve been out like five or so times on a date they go well we get along everything seems nice i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in  i dont know i kind of have a rule that i dont compliment a female on her appearance until she trusts me i did compliment her personality a few times  she is extremely cautious from what iwell now i have a new question went on a second date a few days ago and it went well and she said she wanted to meet up again the problem is there hasnt been an ounce of flirting or touchingshe started initiating with me and asked if im free soon     if there is anything to be learned it is dont play the analysis game you will loseexpectations ofi dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number 2 is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thei dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number 2 is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thethanks option 1 seems most likely it seems whenever i finally get her to open up there is like a cascade of good conversation that finally ensues but it is like pulling teeth initially then iim socially retarded and would know that if a random stranger asked for my contact info then asked me out for drinks or lunch then the person probably isnt interested in just being friendsso i shouldnt be deterred by the fact she doesnt really ever reach out to me i dont enjoy appearing like someone who cant take a hint or who puts someone else in an awkward situation i worryno this seems to fit her

bypriests were relocated to other parishes so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle thing themselves again poor decision but that was their decision  the churchs first prioritywell sure then yes the church did protect child offenders the churchs reasoning was the image of the church itself and the their leaderships own ignorance of the size of the problem the churchedit based double postno it really isnt the bible itself is the canon collection of texts the bible was established once the theological and historical work was done to establish the canon and it was not modifiedyes nevermind it because the two claims do not contradict each other at all i could work through how there is no contradiction if youre struggling    i wouldnt say all no thats a theres no way to tell but many of them depend on logic andor history that contradicts or ruins their claims granted there are a few cases of were yet to be able to know but many of it canthe problem of induction is a grand way of humbling yourself about scientific findings when youre younger it brings into question if what we know is what we could call truerubix cubespantheism makes no sense id advise otherwise atheism and abrahamic theism are the only two rational choicesyou motherfuckerwhat is the meaning of everything the universe exists we are to learn to love in itdisappointed 24 year old reporting in  good luck opthis is exceedingly naive the early church before scripture applied their teaching to better society after scripture it was held in high esteem as a basis to properly better society most workfrom the catholic catechism list of official teaching here is how we are to read the bible  iii the holy spirit interpreter of scripture   109 in sacred scripture god speaks to man in ai never liked people pointing to the scandinavian model for the success of their economic system and not their incredible oil and natural resource supply compared to their small populationswhile shit just got stupid for a moment lets try to get back on trackyoure pretty smart you know that  look at this fucker she thinks im smart pfftexceedingly poorive just been told im bright but im sure most everyone else says the same to the kidsand what of youthe most efficient way to remove selfdoubt is to stop doubting yourself so much faith and trust niggayou suspect wrongly i like the chatter and im being friendly with you i seriously do hope you have a good day tooindeed you do feel free to askarguechator bullshit with me if you want have a good one manid say thats a stretch to say catholics believe the bible was inspired by god but written by men orthodox do too as they assembled the biblical canon id have to say they have the greatest sayedit welpi see the arguments for inconsistencies sometimes they arent actually inconsistencies sometimes they are i find the simplest example of a true one being the rabbit that is apparently chewingsorry to take so long to get back to you my internet has been screwing up horribly  as for the answer there was a considerable amount of things that got me off the atheist train but if i were tothe believing portion was a long and arduous process for me i researched culture as a hobby and eventually i rolled around to religion it was an interesting topic for me and i eventually began toto your first statement just what where did that even come from of course they can know love though with god they can know it fully id argue  as for hell its taken a variety ofim very mixed on him his criticism of christianity and envy now that ive seen the video is while popular piss poor and max scheler did a wonderful job making an argument otherwise on hispeople believing in something as incontrovertibly true is what gets people into a murderous rage why just the incontrovertibly true why not the empirically true why not just majority opinion tosure thing sounds sorta similar to the epicurean paradox  sufferingfree will exists to strengthen the good if you create a people so they may know love they cannot sincerely know love if theyyo christian  here  anything you wantits not we can make healthy children its we only let the healthy babies live which is the issue its a moral issue about the innate value of life249210\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

thats just how i read it what about a four dimensional planewhy airplane why not aeroplanehit them for having the expectation that you should live up to their expectations which is infuriating in and of itself probablyits just because hitting a women is politically incorrect and some women will use that to their advantagewhat hes saying is that they should assume that if they say something worthy of being hit for that they should be grateful when theyre not hit for it not expect not to be hit just on the basisis it particularly common amongst s and other types to just acknowledge another sides

beyond me       no not really again more made up stuffokay this isnt cool  youre specifically looking to get into a relationship because youre about to enter a life phase where you will not have any resources to give to a relationship   that isi do take it slow thats why im still single but im not interested in making friends i  have friends enough for my liking im interested in going on dates with the intent of entering aabsolutely not for me i find the idea repugnant actuallypeople could have been polite maybe average is a more conservative bet and im not claiming im a social butterfly im just a normal guy who is introverted but not a social doofus  i dontim probably giving up the online thing here when my next subscription runs out after that i really dont know where to look bars are a definite no i dont understand where people meet theirive tried both ways actually the last few women i have gone out with have gotten really weird andor ignored my backhanded compliments i dont know what to do anymore seems i get screwed eitherim actually pretty healthy     sorry you feel that way not sure which ones you met but assholes exist everywhere the number isnt anywhere near 99 thoughif

want to know why it is that deformed infirm mentally unstablemy friends are in worse positions than i am asking them isnt going to help   as far as feedback not really because that seems like an extraordinarily awkward thing to ask someone you barelyso im a 26 year old male who has been striking out time and time again when it comes to relationships ive been in one relationship my entire life that lasted like 15 years and ended when i wasi dont think this sort of dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive being friends first just throws a wrench in what is normally a smooth dating process when you fearnever was a kissi appreciate the feedback i think im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it what is happening right now is dragging things out andi dont know after thinking more im on the verge of giving up it has nothing to do with seeing her infrequently or not making it official or what have you its that she keeps thingsi dont know im not a model or anything but im decent looking shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guys are always after her it seems but im also smarter and have better careeri like your answer but maybe im just being optimistic it is basically what ive been doing i cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested andhow am i supposed to know if an  just wants to be friends things have been very weird with an  ive been seeing ive been very upfront about my intentions and she essentially told me sheinteresting i find it unusual infjs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the responses so far have indicated kissing in 3 or fewer datesmy  friend has been with an  and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he was putting her down and felt caged i can see thatenlighten us infjs also indicate your gender and if you initiatedwell there was more than that she also said she was basically trying to figure out if im trustworthy and decentthose two things seem at odds how can you be simultaneously not saying things that need to be said but also being proactively aggressivepretty much yeah women just do not enjoy my company on any level im in the same situation never had any female friends dated one person in my life and it lasted a little less than two years thei dont think that is going to help me dig myself out of the very clingy seeming hole i dug myself i basically asked her if she knew i was romantically interested and she responded of course loli should have just let things proceed at a natural pace pretty pissed at myself about zero chance she speaks to me againi read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anything egregious good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though loli broke that off shortly after my post i felt like a slime ball i only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and i should see other people btw i have a very well developedupdate on this told her i liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested those who said she was ambivalent were right im pretty much calling it off at this pointyeah so i told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt she basically said she had known for a while i like her pretty much what i expected probably going to call itis the crystal ball reference supposed to mean your guess is as good as mine or what edit guess not pso ive gone on six or so dates with an  over a 3 month period shes pretty busy and me too and recently i feel like progress has been a little glacial for a bit i thought she was warming upshe hates texting  and yeah she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of dayyou would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder i would know  not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friends how much you like them that would be more than bizarreits kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assaultspoke to her last night she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to but she also indirectly used the word friend but itso i met an  female a while back and weve been out like five or so times on a date they go well we get along everything seems nice i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in  i dont know i kind of have a rule that i dont compliment a female on her appearance until she trusts me i did compliment her personality a few times  she is extremely cautious from what iwell now i have a new question went on a second date a few days ago and it went well and she said she wanted to meet up again the problem is there hasnt been an ounce of flirting or touchingshe started initiating with me and asked if im free soon     if there is anything to be learned it is dont play the analysis game you will loseexpectations ofi dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number 2 is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thei dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number 2 is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thethanks option 1 seems most likely it seems whenever i finally get her to open up there is like a cascade of good conversation that finally ensues but it is like pulling teeth initially then iim socially retarded and would know that if a random stranger asked for my contact info then asked me out for drinks or lunch then the person probably isnt interested in just being friendsso i shouldnt be deterred by the fact she doesnt really ever reach out to me i dont enjoy appearing like someone who cant take a hint or who puts someone else in an awkward situation i worryno this seems to fit her

subjective see what theyre interested in strike up a conversation about it definitely ask them their thoughtsto dismiss my concept of it is to dismiss all history on the topic dismiss what the apostles taught and literally all sects of christianity but fine whateverdo cool shit discuss ideas have patience dont try to judge personally too quickly or control them also make the first move to show youre interested in talking with themi used to feel about the same until i read the book selfmade man where a lesbian butch woman dressed like a man and tried to live as one she noticed herself being considered a feminine man quiteim not sure what the hell is going on in this thread but i would like to say i know no entjs personally i dont think itd be neat thoughall churches are forms of political institutions catholic and orthodox ones have the benefit of being centralized all sects have declared doctrine in one way or another  youre speaking againstand here is the most boring post in the whole threadwhat part if its the idea of a teaching authority you have a problem with all church until the 13th century if its the idea of a group being guided by the holy spirit in their decisions onfor catholics the church has a dual meaning the whole of the believers the body of christ and the political institution for catholicism their teachings of christ are said to be protected bypriests were relocated to other parishes so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle thing themselves again poor decision but that was their decision  the churchs first prioritywell sure then yes the church did protect child offenders the churchs reasoning was the image of the church itself and the their leaderships own ignorance of the size of the problem the churchedit based double postno it really isnt the bible itself is the canon collection of texts the bible was established once the theological and historical work was done to establish the canon and it was not modifiedyes nevermind it because the two claims do not contradict each other at all i could work through how there is no contradiction if youre struggling    i wouldnt say all no thats a theres no way to tell but many of them depend on logic andor history that contradicts or ruins their claims granted there are a few cases of were yet to be able to know but many of it canthe problem of induction is

thats just how i read it what about a four dimensional planewhy airplane why not aeroplanehit them for having the expectation that you should live up to their expectations which is infuriating in and of itself probablyits just because hitting a women is politically incorrect and some women will use that to their advantagewhat hes saying is that they should assume that if they say something worthy

beyond me       no not really again more made up stuffokay this isnt cool  youre specifically looking to get into a relationship because youre about to enter a life phase where you will not have any resources to give to a relationship   that isi do take it slow thats why im still single but im not interested in making friends i  have friends enough for my liking im interested in going on dates

just a normal guy who is introverted but not a social doofus  i dontim probably giving up the online thing here when my next subscription runs out after that i really dont know where to look bars are a definite no i dont understand where people meet theirive tried both ways actually the last few women i have gone out with have gotten really weird andor ignored my backhanded compliments i dont know

want to know why it is that deformed infirm mentally unstablemy friends are in worse positions than i am asking them isnt going to help   as far as feedback not really because that seems like an extraordinarily awkward thing to ask someone you barelyso im a 26 year old male who has been striking out time and time again when it comes to relationships ive been in one relationship my entire life that lasted like 15 years and ended when i wasi dont think this sort of dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive being friends first just throws a wrench in what is normally a smooth dating process when you fearnever was a kissi appreciate the feedback i think im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it what is happening right now is dragging things out andi dont know after thinking more im on the verge of giving up it has nothing to do with seeing her infrequently or not making it official or what have you its that she keeps thingsi dont know im not a model or anything but im decent looking shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guys are always after her it seems but im also smarter and have better careeri like your answer but maybe im just being optimistic it is basically what ive been doing i cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested andhow am i supposed to know if an  just wants to be friends things have been very weird with an  ive been seeing ive been very upfront about my intentions and she essentially told me sheinteresting i find it unusual infjs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the responses so far have indicated kissing in 3 or fewer datesmy  friend has been with an  and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he was putting her down and felt caged i can see thatenlighten us infjs also indicate your gender and if you initiatedwell there was more than that she also said she was basically trying to figure out if im trustworthy and decentthose two things seem at odds how can you be simultaneously not saying things that need to be said but also being proactively aggressivepretty much yeah women just do not enjoy my company on any level im in the same situation never had any female friends dated one person in my life and it lasted a little less than two years thei dont think that is going to help me dig myself out of the very clingy seeming hole i dug myself i basically asked her if she knew i was romantically interested and she responded of course loli should have just let things proceed at a natural pace pretty pissed at myself about zero chance she speaks to me againi read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anything egregious good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though loli broke that off shortly after my post i felt like a slime ball i only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and i should see other people btw i have a very well developedupdate on this told her i liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested those who said she was ambivalent were right im pretty much calling it off at this pointyeah so i told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt she basically said she had known for a while i like her pretty much what i expected probably going to call itis the crystal ball reference supposed to mean your guess is as good as mine or what edit guess not pso ive gone on six or so dates with an  over a 3 month period shes pretty busy and me too and recently i feel like progress has been a little glacial for a bit i thought she was warming upshe hates texting  and yeah she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of dayyou would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder i would know  not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friends how much you like them that would be more than bizarreits kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assaultspoke to her last night she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to but she also indirectly used the word friend but itso i met an  female a while back and weve been out like five or so times on a date they go well we get along everything seems nice i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in  i dont know i kind of have a rule that i dont compliment a female on her appearance until she trusts me i did compliment her personality a few times  she is extremely cautious from what iwell now i have a new question went on a second date a few days ago and it went well and she said she wanted to meet up again the problem is there hasnt been an ounce of flirting or touchingshe started initiating with me and asked if im free soon     if there is anything to be learned it is dont play the analysis game

this isnt thei dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number 2 is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thethanks option 1 seems most likely it seems whenever i finally get her to open up there is like a cascade of good conversation that finally ensues but it is like pulling teeth initially then iim socially retarded and would know that if a random stranger asked for my contact info then asked me out for drinks or lunch then the person probably isnt interested in just being friendsso i shouldnt be deterred by the fact she doesnt really ever reach out to me i dont enjoy appearing like someone who cant take a hint or who puts someone else in an awkward situation i worryno this seems to fit her

reverberated throughout the churchs dialogues both before and after the incident aboutthats an annoying phrasing as its just obtuse and confusing to newcomers i dont blame you for your response there

questions when musing with the  and just try toheresy is like the core reason most all christian infighting occurs everything else is minor disputes about theological opinionsthats exceedingly subjective see what theyre interested in strike up a conversation about it definitely ask them their thoughtsto dismiss my concept of it is to dismiss all history on the topic dismiss what the apostles taught and literally all sects of christianity but fine whateverdo cool shit discuss ideas have patience dont try to judge personally too quickly or control them also make the first move to show youre interested in talking with themi used to feel about the same until i read the book selfmade man where a lesbian butch woman dressed like a man and tried to live as one she noticed herself being considered a feminine man quiteim not sure what the hell is going on in this thread but i would like to say i know no entjs personally i dont think itd be neat thoughall churches are forms of political institutions catholic and orthodox ones have the benefit of being centralized all sects have declared doctrine in one way or another  youre speaking againstand here is the most boring post in the whole threadwhat part if its the idea of a teaching authority you have a problem with all church until the 13th century if its the idea of a group being guided by the holy spirit in their decisions onfor catholics the church has a dual meaning the whole of the believers the body of christ and the political institution for catholicism their teachings of christ are said to be protected bypriests were relocated to other parishes so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle thing themselves again poor decision but that was their decision  the churchs first prioritywell sure then yes the church did protect child offenders the churchs reasoning was the image of the church itself and the their leaderships own ignorance of the size of the problem the churchedit based double postno it really isnt the bible itself is the canon collection of texts the bible was established once the theological and historical work was done to establish the canon and it was not modifiedyes nevermind it because the two claims do not contradict each other at all i could work through how there is no contradiction if youre struggling    i wouldnt say all no thats a theres no way to tell but many of them depend on logic andor history that contradicts or ruins their claims granted there are a few cases of were yet to be able to know but many of it canthe problem of induction is

the bible was inspired by god but written by men orthodox do too as they assembled the biblical canon id have to say they have the greatest sayedit welpi see the arguments for inconsistencies sometimes they arent actually inconsistencies sometimes they are i find the simplest example of a true one being the rabbit that is apparently chewingsorry to take so long to get back to you my

expectation that you should live up to their expectations which is infuriating in and of itself probablyits just because hitting a women is politically incorrect and some women will use that to their

ihow youve come to the conclusion i have nothing to offer  merely because i am busy is beyond me       no not really again more made up stuffokay this isnt cool  youre specifically looking to get into a relationship because youre about to enter a life phase where you will not have any resources to give to a relationship   that isi do take it slow thats why im still single but im not interested in making friends i  have friends enough for my liking im interested in going on dates with the intent of entering aabsolutely not for me i find the idea repugnant actuallypeople could have been polite maybe average is a more conservative bet and im not claiming im a social butterfly im just a normal guy who is introverted but not a social doofus  i dontim probably giving up the online thing here when my next subscription runs out after that i really dont know where to look bars are a definite no i dont understand where people meet theirive tried both ways actually the last few women i have gone out with have gotten really weird andor ignored my backhanded compliments i dont know what to do anymore seems i get screwed eitherim actually pretty healthy     sorry you feel that way not sure which ones you met but assholes exist everywhere the number isnt anywhere near 99 thoughif anything i err on the side of being indifferent definitely not overeageryeah my close friends dont live near me anymore  the issue is that i have been meeting people a good amount and nothing works i want to know why it is that deformed infirm mentally unstablemy friends are in worse positions than i am asking them isnt going to help   as far as feedback not really because that seems like an extraordinarily awkward thing to ask someone you barelyso im a 26 year old male who has been striking out time and time again when it comes to relationships ive been in one relationship my entire life that lasted like 15 years and ended when i wasi dont think this sort of dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive being friends first just throws a wrench in what is normally a smooth dating process when you fearnever was a kissi appreciate the feedback i think im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it what is happening right now is dragging things out andi dont know after thinking more im on the verge of giving up it has nothing to do with seeing her infrequently or not making it official or what have you its that she keeps thingsi dont know im not a model or anything but im decent looking shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guys are always after her it seems but im also smarter and have better careeri like your answer but maybe im just being optimistic it is basically what ive been doing i cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested andhow am i supposed to know if an  just wants to be friends things have been very weird with an  ive been seeing ive been very upfront about my intentions and she essentially told me sheinteresting i find it unusual infjs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the responses so far have indicated kissing in 3 or fewer datesmy  friend has been with an  and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he was putting her down and felt caged i can see thatenlighten us infjs also indicate your gender and if you initiatedwell there was more than that she also said she was basically trying to figure out if im trustworthy and decentthose two things seem at odds how can you be simultaneously not saying things that need to be said but also being proactively aggressivepretty much yeah women just do not enjoy my company on any level im in the same situation never had any female friends dated one person in my life and it lasted a little less than two years thei dont think that is going to help me dig myself out of the very clingy seeming hole i dug myself i basically asked her if she knew i was romantically interested and she responded of course loli should have just let things proceed at a natural pace pretty pissed at myself about zero chance she speaks to me againi read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anything egregious good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though loli broke that off shortly after my post i felt like a slime ball i only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and i should see other people btw i have a very well developedupdate on this told her i liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested those who said she was ambivalent were right im pretty much calling it off at this pointyeah so i told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt she basically said she had known for a while i like her pretty much what i expected probably going to call itis the crystal ball reference supposed to mean your guess is as good as mine or what edit guess not pso ive gone on six or so dates with an  over a 3 month period shes pretty busy and me too and recently i feel like progress has been a little glacial for a bit i thought she was warming upshe hates texting  and yeah she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of dayyou would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder i would know  not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friends how much you like them that would be more than bizarreits kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assaultspoke to her last night she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to but she also indirectly used the word friend but itso i met an  female a while back and weve been out like five or so times on a date they go well we get along everything seems nice i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in  i dont know i kind of have a rule that i dont compliment a female on her appearance until she trusts me i did compliment her personality a few times  she is extremely cautious from what iwell now i have a new question went on a second date a few days ago and it went well and she said she wanted to meet up again the problem is there hasnt been an ounce of flirting or touchingshe started initiating with me and asked if im free soon     if there is anything to be learned it is dont play the analysis game you will loseexpectations ofi dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really

cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thethanks option 1 seems most likely it seems whenever i finally get her to open up there is like a cascade of good conversation that finally ensues but it is like pulling teeth initially then iim socially retarded and would know that if a random stranger asked for my contact info then asked me out for drinks or lunch then the person probably isnt interested in just being friendsso i shouldnt be deterred by the fact she doesnt really ever reach out to me i dont enjoy appearing like someone who cant take a hint or who puts someone else in an awkward situation i worryno this seems to fit her pretty wellthanks for the advice everyone i appreciate your taking the time to respond\",\n          \"this has to be written with

confusing to newcomers i dont blame you for your response there    why must the revealed knowledge not speak truth but contain a biasthere are no priestly desk jobs the closest thing you have to being

disputes about theological opinionsthats exceedingly subjective see what theyre interested in strike up a conversation about it definitely ask them their thoughtsto dismiss my concept of it is to dismiss all history on the topic dismiss what the apostles taught and literally all sects of christianity but fine whateverdo cool shit discuss ideas have patience dont try to judge personally too quickly or control them also make the first move to show youre interested in talking with themi used to feel about the same until i read the book selfmade man where a lesbian butch woman dressed like a man and tried to live as one she noticed herself being considered a feminine man quiteim not sure what the hell is going on in this thread but i would like to say i know no entjs personally i dont think itd be neat thoughall churches are forms of political institutions catholic and orthodox ones have the benefit of being centralized all sects have declared doctrine in one way or another  youre speaking againstand here is the most boring post in the whole threadwhat part if its the idea of a teaching authority you have a problem with all church until the 13th century if its the idea of a group being guided by the holy spirit in their decisions onfor catholics the church has a dual meaning the whole of the believers the body of christ and the political institution for catholicism their teachings of christ are said to be protected bypriests were relocated to other parishes so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle thing themselves again poor decision but that was their decision  the churchs first prioritywell sure then yes the church did protect child offenders the churchs reasoning was the image of the church itself and the their leaderships own ignorance of the size of the problem the churchedit based double postno it really isnt the bible itself is the canon collection of texts the bible was established once the theological and historical work was done to establish the canon and it was not modifiedyes nevermind it because the two claims do not contradict each other at all i could work through how there is no contradiction if youre struggling    i wouldnt say all no thats a theres no way to tell but many of them depend on logic andor history that contradicts or ruins their claims granted there are a few cases of were yet to be able to know but many of it canthe problem of induction is a grand way of humbling yourself about scientific findings when youre younger it brings into question if what we know is what we could call truerubix

just a normal guy who is introverted but not a social doofus  i dontim probably giving up the online thing here when my next subscription runs out after that i really dont know where to look bars are a definite no i dont understand where people meet theirive tried both ways actually the last few women i have gone out with have gotten really weird andor ignored my backhanded compliments i dont know

want to know why it is that deformed infirm mentally unstablemy friends are in worse positions than i am asking them isnt going to help   as far as feedback not really because that seems like an extraordinarily awkward thing to ask someone you barelyso im a 26 year old male who has been striking out time and time again when it comes to relationships ive been in one relationship my entire life that lasted like 15 years and ended when i wasi dont think this sort of dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive being friends first just throws a wrench in what is normally a smooth dating process when you fearnever was a kissi appreciate the feedback i think im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it what is happening right now is dragging things out andi dont know after thinking more im on the verge of giving up it has nothing to do with seeing her infrequently or not making it official or what have you its that she keeps thingsi dont know im not a model or anything but im decent looking shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guys are always after her it seems but im also smarter and have better careeri like your answer but maybe im just being optimistic it is basically what ive been doing i cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested andhow am i supposed to know if an  just wants to be friends things have been very weird with an  ive been seeing ive been very upfront about my intentions and she essentially told me sheinteresting i find it unusual infjs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the responses so far have indicated kissing in 3 or fewer datesmy  friend has been with an  and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he was putting her down and felt caged i can see thatenlighten us infjs also indicate your gender and if you initiatedwell there was more than that she also said she was basically trying to figure out if im trustworthy and decentthose two things seem at odds how can you be simultaneously not saying things that need to be said but also being proactively aggressivepretty much yeah women just do not enjoy my company on any level im in the same situation never had any female friends dated one person in my life and it lasted a little less than two years thei dont think that is going to help me dig myself out of the very clingy seeming hole i dug myself i basically asked her if she knew i was romantically interested and she responded of course loli should have just let things proceed at a natural pace pretty pissed at myself about zero chance she speaks to me againi read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anything egregious good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though loli broke that off shortly after my post i felt like a slime ball i only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and i should see other people btw i have a very well developedupdate on this told her i liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested those who said she was ambivalent were right im pretty much calling it off at this pointyeah so i told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt she basically said she had known for a while i like her pretty much what i expected probably going to call itis the crystal ball reference supposed to mean your guess is as good as mine or what edit guess not pso ive gone on six or so dates with an  over a 3 month period shes pretty busy and me too and recently i feel like progress has been a little glacial for a bit i thought she was warming upshe hates texting  and yeah she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of dayyou would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder i would know  not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friends how much you like them that would be more than bizarreits kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assaultspoke to her last night she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to but she also indirectly used the word friend but itso i met an  female a while back and weve been out like five or so times on a date they go well we get along everything seems nice i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in  i dont know i kind of have a rule that i dont compliment a female on her appearance until she trusts me i did compliment her personality a few times  she is extremely cautious from what iwell now i have a new question went on a second date a few days ago and it went well and she said she wanted to meet up again the problem is there hasnt been an ounce of flirting or touchingshe started initiating with me and asked if im free soon     if there is anything to be learned it is dont play the analysis game

this isnt thei dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number 2 is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thethanks option 1 seems most likely it seems whenever i finally get her to open up there is like a cascade of good conversation that finally ensues but it is like pulling teeth initially then iim socially retarded and would know that if a random stranger asked for my contact info then asked me out for drinks or lunch then the person probably isnt interested in just being friendsso i shouldnt be deterred by the fact she doesnt really ever reach out to me i dont enjoy appearing like someone who cant take a hint or who puts someone else in an awkward situation i worryno this seems to fit her

show youre interested in talking with themi used to feel about the same until i read the book selfmade man where a lesbian butch woman dressed like a man and tried to live as one she noticed herself

political institutions catholic and orthodox ones have the benefit of being centralized all sects have declared doctrine in one way or another  youre speaking againstand here is the most boring post in the whole threadwhat part if its the idea of a teaching authority you have a problem with all church until the 13th century if its the idea of a group being guided by the holy spirit in their decisions onfor catholics the church has a dual meaning the whole of the believers the body of christ and the political institution for catholicism their teachings of christ are said to be protected bypriests were relocated to other parishes so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle thing themselves again poor decision but that was their decision  the churchs first prioritywell sure then yes the church did protect child offenders the churchs reasoning was the image of the church itself and the their leaderships own ignorance of the size of the problem the churchedit based double postno it really isnt the bible itself is the canon collection of texts the bible was established once the theological and historical work was done to establish the canon and it was not modifiedyes nevermind it because the two claims do not contradict each other at all i could work through how there is no contradiction if youre struggling    i wouldnt say all no thats a theres no way to tell but many of them depend on logic andor history that contradicts or ruins their claims granted there are a few cases of were yet to be able to know but many of it canthe problem of induction is
